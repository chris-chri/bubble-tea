# How i used ai and Youtube
I have used this Youtube video for help and insipartion:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXWohFYrI0M&t=19s
The youtube video also hepled in parts of the java script code. i did change this like how i would do certian things like having the onclick funtion for certain button on my html rather than the java script. i did not always follow the java script in the video.
i used ai for help on parts of my Java script there were issues and a gap of knowledge when developing the coding of my website. it took a long time debugging the website than attually coding to be honest. i did learn how to  save elements/funtions using java script for example saving the quanity of the bubble tea you add in the shopping cart when the user leaves the website or resets the shopping cart does not change. This part of the code was the hardest thing i have done.
